  title={Robotic arm for automatic brake testing and control},
  journal={Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
  abstract={Brake testing is an important verification test before putting an automobile up for sale. Unfortunately, brake judders which act as hindrance for getting true brake performance results canâ€™t be rectified. Therefore, we have to account for brake judders in our brake test results. Our project is aimed at reducing the effects of brake judder by examining the Disc Thickness Variation dynamically with the heat produced because of friction between brake pads and disc as the brake is applied. This thorough examination is done with the help of a capacitive sensor which continuously feeds disc thickness variation data to our robotic arm which is programmed to change the position of the brake pedal in order to keep a uniform brake force on the disc.},
