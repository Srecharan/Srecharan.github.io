Engineer by training, innovator at heart, and passionate about the intersection of machine learning and robotics.

Currently pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Robotics and Intelligent Systems at Carnegie Mellon University, I specialize in developing intelligent solutions that bridge creativity and technology. My work revolves around Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Path Planning, and Perception, striving to make robots smarter and impactful in real-world applications.

With expertise in tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and ROS, I build advanced computer vision systems and scalable models. From training neural networks for object detection to designing real-time tracking systems and enhancing robot autonomy, I tackle complex challenges with a software-focused approach.

I’m eager to collaborate with visionary teams that share a passion for innovation and technology-driven transformation. Let’s connect and create the future together!
