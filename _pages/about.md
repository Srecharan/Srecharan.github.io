I'm a recent MS graduate from Carnegie Mellon University specializing in machine learning, computer vision, and AI systems. My passion lies in building intelligent systems that bridge cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

At Carnegie Mellon, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at Kantor Lab, where I developed a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system through LoRA fine-tuning of LLaVA-1.5-7B foundation model, adapting multimodal reasoning from text generation to action prediction for robotic leaf manipulation. This research combines self-supervised learning, computer vision, and geometric algorithms, involving custom CUDA kernel development and deployment on a 6-DOF gantry robot. The work is currently under review at ICCV 2025.

My industry experience spans ML engineering roles where I built real-time 3D hand gesture recognition for AR-based training systems and developed distributed computer vision pipelines for industrial automation.

Through personal projects, I've explored diverse AI applications: developing Vision-Language Models with RAG and RLHF techniques, building algorithmic trading systems with ensemble ML and sentiment analysis, and creating synthetic data augmentation systems using GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models for data-limited scenarios.

I focus on end-to-end ML pipeline development - from self-supervised data creation through distributed training, optimization with CUDA/TensorRT, and production deployment using Docker and cloud platforms. My approach emphasizes building practical, scalable solutions that actually work in production environments.
