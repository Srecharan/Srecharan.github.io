I'm a recent MS graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a specialization in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and AI systems. My journey in AI has been driven by the excitement of building intelligent systems that work seamlessly in the real world.

At Carnegie Mellon, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at Kantor Lab, where I developed a self-supervised learning pipeline for autonomous robotic leaf manipulation to detect plant diseases. This research combined computer vision, deep learning, and geometric algorithms, and involved everything from custom CUDA kernel development to deploying the complete system on a 6-DOF gantry robot. The work is currently under review at ICCV 2025, which has been an incredible learning experience.

My industry experience includes working as an ML Engineer Intern at Hanon Systems, where I built a real-time 3D hand gesture recognition system for AR-based HVAC training that enabled automotive technicians to practice in virtual environments. I also worked as a Computer Vision Engineer Intern at Vee Ess Engineering, developing distributed data processing pipelines using Apache Spark to revolutionize material recovery on industrial conveyors with real-time ML detection systems.

Beyond my formal work, I've explored diverse AI applications through personal projects. I've developed Vision-Language Models with advanced techniques like RAG and RLHF, built algorithmic trading systems combining ensemble ML with sentiment analysis, and experimented with generative AI including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models for image synthesis.

What I'm passionate about is end-to-end machine learning pipeline development - from dataset creation and preprocessing through model training, optimization, and production deployment. I have hands-on experience with the complete ML lifecycle: distributed training across multiple GPUs, custom optimization using CUDA and TensorRT, containerized deployment with Docker and Kubernetes, and scaling systems on cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. My approach focuses on bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, production-ready solutions that actually work in the real world.
