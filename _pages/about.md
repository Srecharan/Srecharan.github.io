I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Computer Vision and Deep Learning. With a strong foundation in Python and PyTorch, I develop cutting-edge solutions in computer vision and generative AI, with a focus on diffusion models. I have extensive experience in dataset curation, large-scale distributed training, and production deployment, allowing me to deliver comprehensive machine learning solutions from concept to implementation. I am particularly passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI technology while ensuring practical, real-world applications.

Throughout my career, I've contributed to impactful projects at leading organizations:

- At Apple, I enhanced MacBook defect detection systems
- At Hexo, I specialized in fine-tuning stable diffusion models
- As a Robotics Engineer at Orangewood Labs (YC-backed), I achieved a 40% weight reduction in robotic links through topological optimization

My work has been recognized through prestigious awards, including:
- The DAAD-WISE Scholarship
- The K.C. Mahindra Scholarship for Post Graduate Studies Abroad

Currently, as a Graduate Research Assistant at CMU, I'm working on:
- Developing interactive visualizations for Stable Diffusion models
- Developing cloud-native ML pipelines with auto-scaling capabilities for seamless multi-user deployment
