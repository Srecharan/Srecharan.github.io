Hello, I'm a graduate student pursuing my MS at Carnegie Mellon University with a specialization in machine learning, deep learning and computer vision.

As a Graduate Research Assistant at CMU, I've engineered a real-time vision system for autonomous plant manipulation that integrates stereo depth estimation with custom convolutional neural networks through a hybrid approach that combines classical computer vision with deep learning.

My professional journey has taken me through diverse challenges - from designing real-time 3D hand tracking systems for AR interactions at Hanon Systems to implementing multi-camera vision systems for industrial automation at Vee Ess Engineering. Each role has strengthened my expertise in building robust ML systems that perform reliably in complex environments.

I'm fascinated by the capabilities of generative models and Generative AI, having benchmarked GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models for image synthesis, and built end-to-end systems leveraging NLP and time-series analysis for quantitative stock trading.

What drives me is creating ML systems that bridge theoretical performance with practical application. I excel at data acquisition and preprocessing, and I'm proficient with PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and scikit-learn, leveraging these frameworks to develop scalable solutions that deliver real value across industries. My work combines technical rigor with a focus on impact, consistently pushing the boundaries of what's possible in applied machine learning.
