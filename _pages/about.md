Hi, I'm Srecharan, a recent MS graduate from Carnegie Mellon University with a specialization in applied machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning.

My research at CMU focused on building self-supervised learning pipelines for robotic grasping. I developed a perception system that combines YOLOv8 segmentation, stereo depth estimation, and a CNN trained with a self-supervised grasp loss. The goal was to accurately identify and grasp plant leaves to help detect and prevent crop disease in greenhouse environments.

At Hanon Systems, I designed a real-time 3D hand tracking system that enabled automotive technicians to simulate HVAC installations in augmented reality, making the assembly process more intuitive and efficient. As a computer vision intern at Vee Ess Engineering, I implemented multi-camera industrial vision systems to increase recovery rates of high-value components from heavy manufacturing lines.

I've also fine-tuned large language and vision-language models like Qwen and LLaMA using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) techniques (Generative Reinforcement from Pairwise Optimization, Direct Preference Optimization) to generate safety-critical instructions for mechanical tools. In parallel, I built quantitative trading pipelines by combining time-series modeling with sentiment-aware financial indicators to support multi-stock decision making.

I enjoy working across the entire machine learning pipeline â€” from custom dataset creation and model fine-tuning to benchmarking, optimization, and reliable deployment. My focus is always on solving real-world problems with scalable, practical systems that make a measurable difference.

I'm proficient with PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Transformers, ONNX, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP, with experience implementing ML solutions in both research environments and production systems.
