Engineer by training, innovator at heart, and a passionate advocate for the intersection of machine learning and robotics. I thrive in a world where creativity meets technology, constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with artificial intelligence and computer vision. With a foundation in Mechanical Engineering and a deep dive into Robotics, I specialize in tackling complex challenges and delivering innovative solutions.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master's in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Robotics and Intelligent Systems at Carnegie Mellon University. My work explores cutting-edge topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Path Planning, and Perception, with the goal of making robots smarter, more adaptable, and impactful in real-world applications.

I have hands-on experience with powerful tools and frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, which I use to develop advanced computer vision systems and intelligent models. My expertise extends to ROS for robotic system integration and Python for building robust, scalable solutions. Whether it's training neural networks for object detection, designing real-time tracking systems, or integrating sensory feedback for enhanced robot autonomy, I bring a comprehensive software-focused approach to the table.

I’m seeking to collaborate with forward-thinking teams and organizations that aim to redefine the limits of technology. If you're driven by innovation and share a vision of transforming ideas into impactful realities, let’s connect—I’d love to explore how we can create the future together!
