### Introduction
Linear Friction Welding (LFW) is a solid-state joining process that applies oscillatory motion and compressive force to join materials, enabling precise microstructural control for materials like Nickel Aluminium Bronze (NAB). NAB alloys are known for their strength and corrosion resistance, making them valuable in marine and aerospace applications. The project aimed to study the impact of oscillation frequency and amplitude on the properties of NAB joints created through LFW. By analyzing these parameters, this study enhances our understanding of LFW's influence on NAB's microstructure and mechanical properties, promoting its use in high-performance applications.

### Methods
As part of the research team, I focused on analyzing the microstructural changes in NAB joints at various oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, using techniques such as optical and scanning electron microscopy. The project involved setting up the LFW machine, conducting welds at three distinct oscillation frequencies (30 Hz, 50 Hz, 70 Hz), and adjusting amplitude levels (1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm). Macrostructural evaluation, microhardness testing, and tensile testing provided insights into the weld quality and performance under varied welding conditions.

The LFW process was monitored with a thermal camera to assess the peak temperatures achieved, which influence the grain structure in the weld zone and thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ). Microstructure analysis involved examining grain refinement and phase transformations that contribute to joint strength and durability.

### Results
The results showed that higher oscillation frequencies significantly refined the α-phase grains within the weld zone, achieving grain sizes below 5 µm, which enhanced hardness and tensile strength. For example, tensile strength ranged from 503 MPa at lower frequencies to 582 MPa at higher frequencies, with ductility values between 13.5% and 21.7%. Increased amplitude, on the other hand, expanded the flash formation, impacting the weld zone width and potentially reducing joint strength. The volume fraction of the β'-phase also increased with frequency, affecting the NAB joint's mechanical properties.

### Discussion
This research demonstrates that optimizing oscillation frequency and amplitude in LFW can significantly enhance the mechanical properties and microstructure of NAB joints, supporting their application in demanding environments. Controlling these parameters can achieve stronger, more resilient welds, suggesting that LFW is a viable alternative for joining NAB in critical marine and aerospace components. Future work will focus on refining these welding parameters to further improve the strength and durability of NAB welds.
