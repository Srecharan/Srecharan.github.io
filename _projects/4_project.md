title: Mixture of Expert Model for Code Generation
importance: 4
category: work
---

### Introduction
In today's machine learning landscape, code generation models face significant challenges in producing accurate, language-specific code. While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities, their monolithic architecture often struggles to maintain consistent quality across different programming languages. This project addresses this challenge through a novel application of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework to enhance code generation performance.

### Project Objectives
1. Evaluate and implement a Mixture-of-Experts approach for code generation across multiple programming languages
2. Improve code generation quality through specialized expert models
3. Compare performance between baseline and MoE approaches using industry-standard metrics

### Methods

#### Model Architecture
The project utilizes the Mistral-7B architecture as the foundation, with the following key components:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Component</th>
        <th>Specification</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Base Model</td>
        <td>Mistral-7B</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Expert Models</td>
        <td>4 (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Context Length</td>
        <td>32k tokens</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Parameters</td>
        <td>7B per expert</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### Training Process
We implemented a three-phase approach:

**Fine-tuning Phase:**
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using QLoRA
- Language-specific training on curated datasets
- 48-72 hours training per language

**Model Merging:**
- TIES-merging for expert model integration
- Task vector optimization for language specialization

### Results
The MoE implementation demonstrated significant improvements:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Language</th>
        <th>Baseline Score</th>
        <th>MoE Score</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Python</td>
        <td>0.180</td>
        <td>0.400</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Java</td>
        <td>0.186</td>
        <td>0.429</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>JavaScript</td>
        <td>0.191</td>
        <td>0.418</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>C++</td>
        <td>0.217</td>
        <td>0.334</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Overall, the MoE approach achieved a 51% improvement in CodeBLEU scores across all languages.
